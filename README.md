# Flight System G940 - uinput based driver (linux)  
  
User space driver for Flight System G940, based on uinput  
  
This is a very simple (but fast and solid) replacement for the G940 kernel driver.  
  
All axes, buttons and switches are already reported correctly.  
Force-Feedback is not implemented currently.  
  
To use this driver:    
  
ensure 'libusb-1.0-dev' packet is installed on your system  
clone this repo:   
    
**git clone https://github.com/fred41/G940.git    
cd G940    
make**    
  
There should be a file 'g940' now (the driver executable).  
  
You have to add (most likely) two udev rules, to give the driver write access  
to the uinput system and read access to G940 USB device from user space:  
  
KERNEL=="uinput", SYMLINK+="input/uinput", GROUP="input"   
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="046d", ATTR{idProduct}=="c287", MODE="0666"  
  
Add your user to group 'input' if not not already added. Activate the new rules by a restart.  
  
Plug in your G940, run the driver from terminal (./g940) and use 'evtest' or your game   
to test functionality.  
  
Good luck :)
